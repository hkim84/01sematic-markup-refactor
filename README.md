# 01Sematic-markup-refactor

## Description

This challenge is to tidy up this pre built webpage. I am to refractor its existing code to give it a sematic html code. So others developers may be able to read its content through code vs.

## Usage

To show clients, that refractoring a codebase to be more understandable will help other developers to make ongoing improvements for the clients website.
