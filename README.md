# sematic-markup1

## Description

This challenge is to tidy up this pre built webpage. I am to refractor its existing code, so others developers may be able to read its content through chrome dev, vs code, and etc. 

## Usage

To show clients, that refractoring a codebase to be more understandable will help other developers to make ongoing improvements for the clients website.
