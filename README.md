# 01Sematic-markup-refactor

## Description

This challenge I am task to do is make the webpage more complete with sematic html coding. So, we may understand how to refactor an existing code and understanding its functions. 

## Usage

Refactoring has its benefits, so others will understand the html document.Also, it help other developer to make improvements in a more fluid style instead of refactoring everything from scratch.
